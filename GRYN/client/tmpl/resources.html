			a note on the calendar
		</div>
		The Green Yinzers calendar is a curated calendar run by volunteers, meaning we can't include every single local event related to environment, sustainability, and nature. (But we try, and if you want to help us achieve that goal, contact us!) There are a few notable organizations in town with their own consistently packed calendars that are worth sharing. We highly recommend you bookmark them too:
