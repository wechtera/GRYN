		We are the Green Yinzers (GRYN), a Pittsburgh based group with a mission to increase the accessibility to environment related events, inform the public of existing social and environmental interest groups, and increase the connectivity of like minded sustainable conscious individuals.  You can currently find a composite of local events around the greater Pittsburgh region in one place as well as weekly updates for what’s going around you on our GRYN site.  We hope to grow with interest to cover a wide range of sustainable themed services, both environmentally and socially.  Stay tuned for more and yinz stay green.<br><br>
