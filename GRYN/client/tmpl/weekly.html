		<p><strong>Weekly Update:</strong> The black-crested titmouse (Baeolophus atricristatus) (also known as the Mexican titmouse), is a small songbird, a passerine bird in the tit family Paridae. Once considered a subspecies of the tufted titmouse (B. bicolor), it was recognized as a separate species[2] in 2002. It is native to southern Texas, Oklahoma, and east-central Mexico. Vagrants have been seen as far north and east as St. Louis, Missouri.</p>

The male has a long, dark black crest that is usually erect, while the female's crest is not as dark. It is common wherever trees grow, whether they are deciduous, heavy timber, or urban shade trees. Its call peter, peter, peter is similar to that of the tufted titmouse, but shorter. Its diet consists of berries, nuts, spiders, insects, and insect eggs.</p>
